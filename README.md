🌟 Welcome to My Code Cave! 🌟
Hey there, fellow coder! I'm Kenneth—part-time bug whisperer, full-time code magician. 🪄 I dabble in a little bit of everything, and my toolkit is as diverse as my love for coffee ☕ and video games 🎮. Here's what I bring to the table:

Python 🐍: Where automation and innovation collide.

Java ☕: For those robust, coffee-powered enterprise builds.

Front-End Development 🌐: Crafting pixel-perfect web magic.

C & C++ 🔧: Low-level logic, high-level satisfaction.

C# 🎮: The ultimate playground for Unity game devs and beyond.

When I'm not coding up a storm, you'll find me learning new things, conquering video game worlds, or brainstorming the next big project. 🚀

💡 Let's Collaborate!
I’m always up for exciting software development projects and collaborations. Whether you’re looking for a partner-in-code or just want to geek out about tech, feel free to reach out. Let’s make something incredible together!
